  question: `Why am I getting all Indian Songs in Search results, even after I changed the language setting to English.`,
  answer: `First of all, Make sure you have selected the appropriate language in settings.

To solve the issue you can either use a VPN with any Indian Server or use the youtube section of the app.`

  question: `While importing Playlists from Spotify I am getting all Indian Songs. Why so?`,

Also, if you're not from India, use a VPN with an Indian server.`
